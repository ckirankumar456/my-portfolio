            <h3>Chess Board</h3>
            <p>
              I created a chessboard design using HTML and CSS Grid, adding
              smooth hover effects to make it more interactive and visually
              appealing. The layout was designed to be clean, responsive, and
              user-friendly. I used the CSS Grid concept to arrange the boxes
              evenly and applied hover styling for an enhanced user experience.

              I developed a calculator application using HTML, CSS, and

            <h3>Image Slides</h3>
            <p>
              I developed an interactive image slider using core JavaScript and
              DOM manipulation. It displays one item at a time, and when a user
              clicks on an item, related category buttons appear dynamically. On
              moving to the next item, these buttons hide automatically. This
              project highlights my skills in JavaScript event handling, DOM
              updates, and dynamic UI design without external frameworks.

              I designed and developed a website using React by taking

            <p>
              I built an OCR Image Text Extraction web app using the MERN stack.
              It uses Tesseract.js for text recognition and jsPDF for creating
              PDFs. Users can upload images, extract and edit text, then
              download clean, formatted PDFs. The frontend was made with
              React.js and React Hooks, and the backend with Node.js,
              Express.js, and MySQL for data storage.
