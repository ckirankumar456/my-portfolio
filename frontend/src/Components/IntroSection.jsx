          <p>
            I’m Kiran Kumar, a passionate Frontend Developer specializing in
            building modern and user-friendly web applications using React.js. I
            completed my MBA in 2024 from Sai Rajeswari Institute of Technology,
            Proddatur, and later shifted my focus to software development due to
            my strong interest in technology.
          </p>

          <p>
            From jan 2025 to jun 2025, I trained in Html, Css, JavaScript,
            React.js and Redux Toolkit and gained basic knowledge of the MERN
            stack. I built real-world projects like an eCommerce website and a
            Todo app, which helped me understand React hooks, components,
            routing, and state management.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am comfortable with Git, REST APIs, and Postman, and I enjoy
            writing clean code and designing good user interfaces. I always try
            to improve my skills by learning new tools and following best
            practices in frontend development.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am now looking for a Frontend Developer role where I can grow my
            skills, work with a supportive team, and contribute to building
            meaningful, user-focused web applications.
